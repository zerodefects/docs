For Users
--------------

The following resources are a good place to start:

* `README page for ODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/OpenDroneMap>`_
* `README page for WebODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/WebODM>`_
* `README page for NodeODM <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/node-OpenDroneMap>`_
* `Ground Control Points Format Specification <https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM/blob/master/doc/source/gcp.rst>`_
* `OpenDroneMap: The Missing Guide <https://odmbook.com/>`_

For Developers
--------------

In addition to user resources, we recommend to also read the following:

* WebODM documentation: https://docs.webodm.org
* NodeODM API specification: https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/NodeODM/blob/master/docs/index.adoc
* Overview of the ODM pipeline: http://community.opendronemap.org/t/where-can-i-find-background-information-on-the-concepts-of-odm/665/2
* We keep a `section in our forum dedicated to research papers <http://community.opendronemap.org/c/ideas-proposals/research-papers>`_. This is a valuable place where to read more about state of the art research related to structure from motion, multi-view stereo, meshing, texturing, etc. which can be used to improve the software.
