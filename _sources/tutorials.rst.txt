*********************************
Creating High Quality Orthophotos
*********************************

Without any parameter tweaks, ODM chooses a good compromise between quality, speed and memory usage. If you want to get higher quality results, you need to tweak some parameters:

 * ``--orthophoto-resolution`` is the resolution of the orthophoto in cm/pixel. Decrease this value for a higher resolution result.
 * ``--ignore-gsd`` is a flag that instructs ODM to skip certain memory and speed optimizations that directly affect the orthophoto. Using this flag will increase runtime and memory usage, but may produce sharper results.
 * ``--texturing-nadir-weight`` should be increased to ``29-32`` in urban areas to reconstruct better edges of roofs. It should be decreased to ``0-6`` in grassy / flat areas.
 * ``--texturing-data-term`` should be set to `area` in forest areas.
 * ``--mesh-size`` should be increased to `300000-600000` and `--mesh-octree-depth`` should be increased to `10-11` in urban areas to recreate better buildings / roofs.

**********************
Calibrating the Camera
**********************

Camera calibration is a special challenge with commodity cameras. Temperature changes, vibrations, focus, and other factors can affect the derived parameters with substantial effects on resulting data. Automatic or self calibration is possible and desirable with drone flights, but depending on the flight pattern, automatic calibration may not remove all distortion from the resulting products. James and Robson (2014) in their paper `Mitigating systematic error in topographic models derived from UAV and ground‐based image networks <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/esp.3609>`_ address how to minimize the distortion from self-calibration.

*Bowling effect on point cloud over 13,000+ image dataset collected by World Bank Tanzania over the flood prone Msimbasi Basin, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.*

To mitigate this effect, there are a few options but the simplest are as follows: fly two patterns separated by 20°, and rather than having a nadir (straight down pointing) camera, use one that tilts forward by 5°.

.. figure:: images/flightplanning.gif

  :align: center
  :height: 480
  :width: 640

As this approach to flying can be take longer than typical flights, a pilot or team can fly a small area using the above approach. OpenDroneMap will generate a calibration file called cameras.json that then can be imported to be used to calibrate another flight that is more efficiently flown.

Alternatively, the following experimental method can be applied: fly with much lower overlap, but two *crossgrid* flights (sometimes called crosshatch) separated by 20° with a 5° forward facing camera.

* Crossgrid overlap percentages can be lower than parallel flights. To get good 3D results, you will require 68% overlap and sidelap for an equivalent 83% overlap and sidelap.
* To get good 2D and 2.5D (digital elevation model) results, you will require 42% overlap and sidelap for an equivalent 70% overlap and sidelap.

Vertically separated flight lines also improve accuracy, but less so than a camera that is forward facing by 5°.

*********************************
Creating Digital Elevation Models
*********************************

By default ODM does not create DEMs. To create a digital terrain model, make sure to pass the ``--dtm`` flag. To create a digital surface model, be sure to pass the ``--dsm`` flag.

.. figure:: images/digitalsurfacemodel.png

For DTM generation, a Simple Morphological Filter (smrf) is used to classify points in ground vs. non-ground and only the ground points are used. The ``smrf`` filter can be controlled via several parameters:

 * ``--smrf-scalar`` scaling value. Increase this parameter for terrains with lots of height variation.
 * ``--smrf-slope`` slope parameter, which is a measure of "slope tolerance". Increase this parameter for terrains with lots of height variation. Should be set to something higher than 0.1 and not higher than 1.2.
 * ``--smrf-threshold`` elevation threshold. Set this parameter to the minimum height (in meters) that you expect non-ground objects to be.
 * ``--smrf-window`` window radius parameter (in meters) that corresponds to the size of the largest feature (building, trees, etc.) to be removed. Should be set to a value higher than 10.

Changing these options can affect the result of DTMs significantly. The best source to read to understand how the parameters affect the output is to read the original paper `An improved simple morphological filter for the terrain classification of airborne LIDAR data <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258333806_An_Improved_Simple_Morphological_Filter_for_the_Terrain_Classification_of_Airborne_LIDAR_Data>`_ (PDF freely available).

Overall the ``--smrf-threshold`` option has the biggest impact on results.

SMRF is good at avoiding Type I errors (small number of ground points mistakenly classified as non-ground) but only "acceptable" at avoiding Type II errors (large number non-ground points mistakenly classified as ground). This needs to be taken in consideration when generating DTMs that are meant to be used visually, since objects mistaken for ground look like artifacts in the final DTM.

.. figure:: images/smrf.png
   :alt: image of lens distortion effect on bowling of data
   :align: center

Two other important parameters affect DEM generation:

 * ``--dem-resolution`` which sets the output resolution of the DEM raster (cm/pixel)
 * ``--dem-gapfill-steps`` which determines the number of progressive DEM layers to use. For urban scenes increasing this value to `4-5` can help produce better interpolation results in the areas that are left empty by the SMRF filter.

Example of how to generate a DTM::

    docker run -ti --rm -v /my/project:/datasets/code <my_odm_image> --project-path /datasets --dtm --dem-resolution 2 --smrf-threshold 0.4 --smrf-window 24

.. _ground-control-points:

*********************
Ground Control Points
*********************

Ground control points are useful for correcting distortions in the data and referencing the data to know coordinate systems.

	The format of the GCP file is simple.

	 * The first line should contain the name of the projection used for the geo coordinates.
	 * Subsequent lines are the X, Y & Z coordinates, your associated pixels and the image filename.

	GCP file format::

	    <projection string>
	    <geo_x> <geo_y> <geo_z> <im_x> <im_y> <image_name>
	    ...

WGS84, UTM, and proj4 geospatial coordinates are supported. For more information about the file format read the `Ground Control Points Format Specification <https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM/blob/master/doc/source/gcp.rst/>`_.

	e.g. for the Langley dataset::

	    +proj=utm +zone=10 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs
	    544256.7 5320919.9 5 3044 2622 IMG_0525.jpg
	    544157.7 5320899.2 5 4193 1552 IMG_0585.jpg
	    544033.4 5320876.0 5 1606 2763 IMG_0690.jpg

	If you supply a GCP file called gcp_list.txt then ODM will automatically detect it. If it has another name you can specify using ``--gcp <path>``. If you have a gcp file and want to do georeferencing with exif instead, then you can specify ``--use-exif``.

	`This post has some information about placing Ground Control Targets before a flight <http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ground-control-points-gcps-for-aerial-photography>`_, but if you already have images, you can find your own points in the images post facto. It's important that you find high-contrast objects that are found in **at least** 3 photos, and that you find a minimum of 5 objects.

	Sharp corners are good picks for GCPs. You should also place/find the GCPs evenly around your survey area.

	The ``gcp_list.txt`` file must be created in the base of your project folder.

	For good results your file should have a minimum of 15 lines after the header (5 points with 3 images to each point).

*******************************
Ground Control Points Interface
*******************************

WebODM has a GCP interface, and example of which can be seen on `the WebODM Demo <http://demo.webodm.org/plugins/posm-gcpi/>`_. To use this with known ground control XYZ values, one would do the following:

Create a GCP list that only includes gcp name (this is the label that will be seen in the GCP interface), x, y, and z, with a header with a proj4 string of your GCPs (make sure they are in a planar coordinate system, such as UTM. It should look something like this:

::

	+proj=utm +zone=37 +south +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs
	gcp01 529356.250827686 9251137.5643209 8.465
	gcp02 530203.125367657 9250140.80991621 15.781
	gcp03 530292.136003818 9250745.02372435 11.977
	gcp04 530203.125367657 9250140.80991621 15.781
	gcp05 530292.136003818 9250745.02372435 11.977

Then one can load this GCP list into the interface, load the images, and place each of the GCPs in the image.

************
Using Docker
************

Since many users employ docker to deploy OpenDroneMap, it can be useful to understand some basic commands in order to interrogate the docker instances when things go wrong, or we are curious about what is happening. Docker is a containerized environment intended, among other things, to make it easier to deploy software independent of the local environment. In this way, it is similar to virtual machines.

A few simple commands can make our docker experience much better.

Listing Docker Machines
=======================

We can start by listing available docker machines on the current machine we are running as follows:

::

    > docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
    2518817537ce        opendronemap/odm       "bash"                   36 hours ago        Up 36 hours                                  zen_wright
    1cdc7fadf688        opendronemap/nodeodm   "/usr/bin/nodejs /va…"   37 hours ago        Up 37 hours         0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   flamboyant_dhawan

If we want to see machines that may not be running but still exist, we can add the `-a` flag:

::

    > docker ps -a
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                    NAMES
    2518817537ce        opendronemap/odm       "bash"                   36 hours ago        Up 36 hours                                        zen_wright
    1cdc7fadf688        opendronemap/nodeodm   "/usr/bin/nodejs /va…"   37 hours ago        Up 37 hours               0.0.0.0:3000->3000/tcp   flamboyant_dhawan
    cd7b9585b8f6        opendronemap/odm       "bash"                   3 days ago          Exited (1) 37 hours ago                            nostalgic_lederberg
    e31010c00b9a        opendronemap/odm       "python /code/run.py…"   3 days ago          Exited (2) 3 days ago                              suspicious_kepler
    c44e0d0b8448        opendronemap/nodeodm   "/usr/bin/nodejs /va…"   3 days ago          Exited (0) 37 hours ago                            wonderful_burnell

Accessing logs on the instance
==============================

Using either the `CONTAINER ID` or the name, we can access any logs available on the machine as follows:

::

    > docker logs 2518817537ce

This is likely to be unwieldy large, but we can use a pipe `|` character and other tools to extract just what we need from the logs. For example we can move through the log slowly using the `more` command:

::

    > docker logs 2518817537ce | more
    [INFO]    DTM is turned on, automatically turning on point cloud classification
    [INFO]    Initializing OpenDroneMap app - Mon Sep 23 01:30:33  2019
    [INFO]    ==============
    [INFO]    build_overviews: False
    [INFO]    camera_lens: auto
    [INFO]    crop: 3
    [INFO]    debug: False
    [INFO]    dem_decimation: 1
    [INFO]    dem_euclidean_map: False
    ...

Pressing `Enter` or `Space`, arrow keys or `Page Up` or `Page Down` keys will now help us navigate through the logs. The lower case letter `Q` will let us escape back to the command line.

We can also extract just the end of the logs using the `tail` commmand as follows:

::

    > docker logs 2518817537ce | tail -5
    [INFO]    Cropping /datasets/code/odm_orthophoto/odm_orthophoto.tif
    [INFO]    running gdalwarp -cutline /datasets/code/odm_georeferencing/odm_georeferenced_model.bounds.gpkg -crop_to_cutline -co NUM_THREADS=8 -co BIGTIFF=IF_SAFER -co BLOCKYSIZE=512 -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE -co BLOCKXSIZE=512 -co TILED=YES -co PREDICTOR=2 /datasets/code/odm_orthophoto/odm_orthophoto.original.tif /datasets/code/odm_orthophoto/odm_orthophoto.tif --config GDAL_CACHEMAX 48.95%
    Using band 4 of source image as alpha.
    Creating output file that is 111567P x 137473L.
    Processing input file /datasets/code/odm_orthophoto/odm_orthophoto.original.tif.

The value `-5` tells the tail command to give us just the last 5 lines of the logs.

Command line access to instances
================================

Sometimes we need to go a little deeper in our exploration of the process for OpenDroneMap. For this, we can get direct command line access to the machines. For this, we can use `docker exec` to execute a `bash` command line shell in the machine of interest as follows:

::
    > docker exec -ti 2518817537ce bash
    root@2518817537ce:/code#

Now we are logged into our docker instance and can explore the machine.

Cleaning up after Docker
========================

Docker has a lamentable use of space and by default does not clean up excess data and machines when processes are complete. This can be advantageous if we need to access a process that has since terminated, but carries the burden of using increasing amounts of storage over time. Maciej Łebkowski has an `excellent overview of how to manage excess disk usage in docker <https://lebkowski.name/docker-volumes/>`_.

*************************************
Using ODM from low-bandwidth location
*************************************

What is this and who is it for?
===============================

Via Ivan Gayton's: [repo](https://github.com/ivangayton/GDAL_scripts/)

`OpenDroneMap <https://www.opendronemap.org/>`__ can’t always be
effectively set up locally—it takes a fairly powerful machine to process
large datasets—so a cloud machine can sometimes be the answer for people
in the field. However, bandwidth is a problem in many low-income
settings. This constraint can’t be solved completely, but the following
method does a reasonable job of reducing the bandwidth needed to process
drone imagery datasets on the cloud from African locations.

Here we present a tricky but workable process to create an OpenDroneMap
cloud machine (*not* CloudODM, mind you, just a cloud-based instance of
ODM that you run from the command line) and use it to remotely process
large photo sets. It requires familiarity with Unix command line use,
ssh, a Digital Ocean account (Amazon AWS would work as well, possibly
with slight differences in the setup), and a moderate level of general
computer literacy. If you aren’t fairly computer-savvy and willing to
fuss with a slightly tricky setup,
`CloudODM <https://www.opendronemap.org/cloudodm/>`__ is what you should
be looking at.

The whole process is mostly targeted at someone flying substantial
missions in an African or similar location looking to process data ASAP
while still in a field setting. Therefore it emphasizes a workflow
intended to reduce bandwidth/data transfer, rather than just the
simplest way of running ODM.

Steps
=====

Install
-------

-  Create a Digital Ocean droplet with at least 4GB of RAM. That’ll cost
   about $20/month. Less than 4GB of RAM and the install will probably
   fail. When we actually run the ODM process we’ll resize it to a much
   larger—and more expensive—cloud machine, but between runs you can
   downsize it between runs to the second-cheapest droplet which costs
   only $10/month (the cheapest droplet, at $5/month, comes with such a
   small drive that you can’t downsize back to it).

   -  Should be an Ubuntu 16.04 instance to ensure dependency
      compatibility
   -  Create a user with sudo privileges. `Digital Ocean’s insanely good
      documentation <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04>`__
      can help you figure this out. In our case we set up a user called
      ``odm``, so connecting to it is via the command
      ``ssh odm@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`` (where the x’s stand for the IPv4
      address of your server). If you want to follow this example
      closely, *do* use the username ``odm``; then your install path
      will be ``/home/odm/ODM/`` and will match all of the examples in
      this document. -When you log into the server, it will offer you
      the option to upgrade to Ubuntu 18.04, a more recent version.
      Don’t. ODM native install doesn’t work smoothly on 18.04. Go ahead
      and execute ``sudo apt update`` and ``sudo apt upgrade`` to ensure
      your server isn’t dangerously without updates, but stay with
      Ubuntu 16.04.

-  Download and install ODM on it from the `ODM
   Github <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM>`__ (regular, not WebODM)
   with the following commands:

::

   git pull https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM.git
   cd ODM
   bash configure.sh install

-  If you do this from the default home folder of your user
   (i.e. ``odm``) the path to the install will be ``/home/odm/ODM``
   (abbreviated as ``~/ODM/``).
-  There are some environmental variables that need to be set. Open the
   ~/.bashrc file on your machine and add the following 3 lines at the
   end (From `the ODM github <https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM>`__).
   The file can be opened with ``nano ~/.bashrc`` (or whatever text
   editor you use in lieu of nano). Be sure to replace ``/home/odm/``
   with the correct path to the location where you extracted
   OpenDroneMap if you didn’t do everything exactly as in our example
   (for example if you used a different username in your server setup):

::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/odm/ODM/SuperBuild/install/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/odm/ODM/SuperBuild/src/opensfm
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/odm/ODM/SuperBuild/install/lib

-  Note that the ODM github readme contains a slight error, the install
   directory name will be ODM, not OpenDroneMap (you’ll see this if you
   compare the above instructions to the ones on the ODM GitHub).

-  In order to prevent a crash wherein the split-merge process fails to
   locate its own executable, we add the following lines to
   ``~/.bashrc`` (adjust paths if you’ve set things up differently from
   our example):

::

   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/odm/ODM/
   export PATH=$PATH:/home/odm/ODM/

-  Now you’ll need a second cloud hard drive (a “Volume” in Digital
   Ocean jargon) big enough to manage your project. Rule of thumb seems
   to be 10 times the size of your raw image set; we’ve got a 100GB
   image set and set up a 1000GB volume (once the run is done you should
   be able to get rid of most of this expensive drive capacity, but it’s
   needed to complete the process). Set up the volume, attach it to your
   droplet, and `configure its mount
   point <https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/volumes/how-to/mount/>`__
   (in this example we’re setting it to ``/mnt/odmdata/``).

Prep data and project
---------------------

-  Now push your images onto the server. You can use `Secure Copy
   (scp) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy>`__ like so:
   ``scp -r /path/to/my/imagefolder odm@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/mnt/odmdata/``.

   -  This pushes the entire folder full of images (that’s what the
      ``-r`` option does, “recursive”) into the remote location (in our
      example, into the volume we attached to the cloud machine at
      ``/mnt/odmdata/``.
   -  This will take some bandwidth. No way around the size of the
      files.\ `1 <#footnote1>`__, \ `2 <#footnote2>`__\ 

Directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ODM requires the directories on the machine to be set up just so. The
critical bits are the install folder (if you installed as above, it’s
``/home/odm/ODM/``) and the project folder
(i.e. ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/``)

-  ODM’s settings.yaml file specifies a single parent directory
   containing all projects. This is what goes in the project path line
   of the settings.yaml file (slightly confusingly, this is actually the
   *parent* directory of the individual project directories, which are
   specified by the project name parameter when calling ODM). Edit
   settings.yaml and set the project_path parameter to (as per our
   example setup) ``/mnt/odmdata/``, which in this case points to the
   Volume we created. Individual project directories are created within
   that.
-  Individual project directories, i.e. ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/``
   contain the gcp_list.txt file, the image_groups.txt file, and the
   images folder for each project``\`
-  The images folder, i.e. ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/images/`` contains
   all of the images. If you set it up like this, the images don’t get
   re-copied because they’re already in the directory that ODM wants
   them in.
-  If you’ve got images with GPS info on them (as from an Ebee), use
   exiftool to massage the GPS information
   ``exiftool "-GPSDOP<GPSZAccuracy" .``.\ `3 <#footnote3>`__\  To do so
   you’ll need to install exiftool. The command for that is probably
   ``sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl``.
-  Modify settings.yaml to specify the parent directory of the project
   folder (in this case the Volume we created, ``/mnt/odmdata/``). Make
   sure the images are in the correct spot,
   i.e. ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/images`` and the other ancillary files
   (gcp_list.txt and image_groups.txt) are in the root folder
   ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/``
-  if you have the images in separate folders for individual AOI blocks
   or flights (which you will if your flight management was organized),
   you can create an image_groups.txt file with the incantations
   ``for i in *; do cd $i; for j in *; do echo "$j $i" >> ../$i.txt; done; cd ../; done;``
   and ``cd ../``,
   ``for i in myproject/*.txt; do cat $i >> image_groups.txt; done;``.
   That should create a file with the correct structure: a list of all
   image files and a “group name” after each one (which in this case
   will simply be the name of the folder it came from). Then move all of
   the image files into a single directory called images in the project
   root dir (so ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/images/``). The
   image_groups.txt file will allow ODM to keep track of which images
   belong to the same batch, even though they’re all in a single
   directory.

Resize droplet, pull pin, run away
----------------------------------

-  Shut down and resize your machine to an appropriately monstrous
   number of CPUs and amount of memory. I use the memory-optimized
   machine with 24 dedicated vCPUs and 192GB of RAM (which costs about
   $1.60/hr—which adds up fast, it’s over $1000/month). Restart, and get
   to work quickly so as not to waste expensive big-droplet time.
-  Launch the ODM process via ssh using nohup (so that if you’re cut
   off, processing will continue)

   -  Alternately you can use GNU screen to launch the process from a
      screen session which won’t stop if your connection is interrupted;
      launch ``screen``, and use ``<ctrl> a <ctrl> d`` to detach,
      ``screen -r`` to re-attach. But using screen won’t get you a log
      file of all of the console output unless you do something specific
      to capture that, while nohup gives you a file with all of the
      console output, including error messages, for free.
   -  Note: as of 2020-03 the normal incantation
      ``python run.py -i /path/to/image/folder project_name`` seems
      *not* to work; the ``-i`` or ``--image`` parameter causes a weird
      error. So we drop the -i parameter, and rely on the project
      directory line in the settings.yaml file to direct ODM to the
      right place. Now using (including a split-merge):

::

   nohup python run.py myproject --split 1 --split-overlap 0 --ignore-gsd --depthmap-resolution 1000 --orthophoto-resolution 5 --dem-resolution 15 --pc-las --dsm

-  This points ODM at the folder (in this example)
   ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/``. Provided the image_groups.txt and
   gcp_list.txt are in this folder, the images are in
   ``/mnt/odmdata/myproject/images/``, and the project path in
   settings.yaml is ``/mnt/odmdata/`` it will not waste time and space
   copying images.

-  Note that this assumes you have an image_groups.txt file. If not,
   this ``-split-overlap 0`` will probably fuck things up, and the
   ``--split 1`` is literally a random number that will be ignored after
   the image_groups.txt file is loaded (I think it normally controls how
   many groups it splits a set of images into, but in our case we’re
   assuming the images are already grouped sensibly). If you don’t have
   a large dataset (>1000 images), omit the ``--split`` and
   ``--split-overlap`` options.

-  Follow the progress using tail (so that you’ll know when it’s done)

::

   tail -f nohup.out

-  You may want to keep an eye on htop (to get a sense of the resource
   usage so that in future you can only spin up a machine as large as
   necessary)

After it finishes (assuming you survive that long)
--------------------------------------------------

-  As soon as processing is done, shut down the machine and resize it
   back down to the inexpensive minimum capacity.
-  Start the machine back up, and log in via ssh.
-  If you want to save download bandwidth, you can compress the
   orthophoto using GDAL. Don’t add overviews, do that on your local
   machine to avoid making the file bigger before downloading it.

::

   gdal_translate -co COMPRESS=JPEG -co PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR -co TILED=YES -b 1 -b 2 -b 3 -mask 4 --config GDAL_TIFF_INTERNAL_MASK YES /path/to/original/filename.extension /path/to/output.tif

-  Download using scp:
   ``scp odm@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:/mnt/odmdata/myproject/odm_orthophoto/odm_orthophoto.tif``
   (or grab the compressed version you created in the last step)

-  Once you get the file on your local computer, you can use QGIS to add
   overviews (“pyramids”) or use the GDAL command
   ``gdaladdo -r average /path/to/image.tif 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024``.

-  You can archive the odm_texturing, odm_georeferencing, and odm-dem
   folders using tar to make them easier to download in one piece (and
   maybe smaller).

::

   tar -zcvf archivename /path/to/folder
