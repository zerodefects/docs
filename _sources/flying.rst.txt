Flying tips
===========

The `Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team <https://www.hotosm.org/>`_ has guidelines on `flying for UAV mapping <https://uav-guidelines.openaerialmap.org/>`_:

- `Choosing the right UAV <https://uav-guidelines.openaerialmap.org/pages/05-choosing-the-right-uav/>`_ 

- `Choosing the right sensor <https://uav-guidelines.openaerialmap.org/pages/06-choosing-the-sensor/>`_ 

- `Mission preparation <https://uav-guidelines.openaerialmap.org/pages/07-preparing-for-the-uav-mission/>`_

The guidelines are intended for drone mapping projects on islands, but have general use for all drone mappers.

See also DroneDeploy's guide on `Making Successful Maps <https://support.dronedeploy.com/docs/making-successful-maps>`_, which provides great tips on mission planning.

Finally, lens distortion is a challenge in projects requiring accurate 3D data. See our section in these docs on `Camera Calibration <tutorials.html#calibrating-the-camera>`_.
